This was my senior project in 2010 - 2011 and after I finished school I haven't kept up on this project well. I would like to start changing that.  

Details:  This project uses an arduino microcontroller to communicate between a basic digital signal system (we used car electronics for this, but anything can be used)
and a cellular phone, through a telit M2M cellular module.

Hardware:
1) Arduino Mega (this is what we used in the project for the multiple serial lines, but a duemilinova or uno would work fine).
2) Telit GM862-GPS

Software:
Arduino IDE to load and run the C code onto the arduino
